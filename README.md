## Project Idea:
    Our 2020-Liquid hack project aims to simulate the application process of a Team Liquid candidate. The goal is to capture TL's spirit while focusing the health/relationship aspect of gaming. Due to the short time frame, we limited the game to TL's League team.

    Throughout the game, the player will be presented various choices such as food, practice time, gym, etc. The player's choice will affect the skill level and the wellbeing of the player. These stats will later be used to determine whether or not the player make the TL team.
